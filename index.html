    <h2>Example text-align: justify</h2>

    <p>
      The text-align: justify; value stretches the lines so
      that each line has equal width (like in newspapers and
      magazines).

      In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
      me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind
      ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing
      anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the
      people in this world haven't had the advantages that
      you've had.'
